# Chat Application

## Description
This is a simple chat-app built with Swift 3.1 and Google's Firebase. The user wil be able to chat, send videos and photos with other users that are signed up on the platform. This app is at a very early stage and I might be adding some other features in the future. NEXT INSTAGRAM?! ;]

### Sightings
This applications enables the user to easily view all reported sightings within their area. 
This is without browsing multiple groups on Facebook, G+ or other forums. A sighting only shows for a certain amount of time 
which means that sightings which has expired (pokemon has certainly despawned) will not be shown.

### Recieve pushnotifications
You will never miss a message from a friend!
